# Spotify - Python: Predictive Modeling, Machine Learning, & Song Recommendations.
This is my first attempt at using open-source Spotify data to predict songs I will enjoy listening to.

The purpose/objective of this project is:

Gather all song listening data from Spotify; use this data to summarize my musical taste; create a tool - similar to the song recommendation
feature in Spotify - to independently get song recommendations based on my listening history.

The code in the attached files mainly uses the following Python libraries:

1.) Pandas - I used this library for all data analysis/manipulation, organization (filtering, sorting, slicing, etc.), and categorization.

2.) Numpy - This was primarily used for data manipulation, transformation to arrays and to furture help develop my predictive models.

3.) Matplotlib - I used this library for: basic graphing of the results from my models, graphing of the current music I like, and
to help assign the most efficient variables to my predictive models.

4.) Sklearn - This libary was used for my two predictive modeling techniques (K-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forests Classifier).
